1. Run npm init : this creates a basic package.json file
2. Run npm i --save-dev nodemon : installs nodemon to automatically refresh terminal while coding, check package.json to see the "dependency" section
3. Inside package.json after "main" create "scripts": if it does not already exist, the following can be copied and pasted into package.json
   "scripts": {
   "devStart": "nodemon express.js"
   },

and you should see this structure

"main": "index.js",
"scripts": {
"devStart": "nodemon index.js"
},
"author": "David Turner",

if scripts already exists do the following, NOTE a comma has to seperate the 2

"scripts": {
"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
"devStart": "nodemon index.js"

}, 4. Then run the command npm run devStart
